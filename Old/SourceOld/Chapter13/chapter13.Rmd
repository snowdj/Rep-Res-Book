# The Basics

## Headings

Headings in Markdown are extremely simple. To create a line in the style of the topmost heading--maybe a title--just place one hash mark (`#`) at the beginning of the line. The second tier heading just gets two hashes (`##`) and so on. You can also put the hash mark(s) at the end of the heading, but this is not necessary.
