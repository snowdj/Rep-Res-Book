# Description of the Origins of Reproducible Research in R and RStudio

The book began as a class called Introductory Data Analysis for Social Science that I began to put together in April and May 2012. The basic idea for the course was to have a place where students could learn how the whole process of data collection, analysis, and presentation. Sure there are lots of statistics courses, some even covering the practicalities of data analysis using computers. However, all through my undergrad masters, masters again, and PhD I never had a course that brought all of of the major parts of quantitative data analysis together into one place. 

A big stumbling block for me and many other people I know was trying to take the information I learned in a stats class and actually use it in my own research. Just lfiguring out how to get new data into **R** was a really big challenge. This seemingly simple task has turned away many researchers from tools that could really help their research. I wanted a course that actually gave my students the tools to *do* research.
