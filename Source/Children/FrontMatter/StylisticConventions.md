%% Stylistic Conventions for Reproducible Research with R and RStudio

I use the following conventions throughout this book:

- **Abstract variables**: Abstract variables, i.e. variables that do not
represent specific objects in an example, are in `ALL CAPS TYPEWRITER TEXT`.

- **Clickable buttons**: Clickable Buttons are in `typewriter text`.

- **Code**: All code is in `typewriter text`.

- **Filenames and directories**: Filenames and directories more generally are
printed in *italics*. I use CamelBack for file and directory names.

- **File extensions**: Like filenames, file extensions are *italicized*.

- **Individual variable values**: Individual variable values mentioned in the
text are in *italics*.

- **Objects**: Objects are printed in *italics*. I use CamelBack for object names.

- **Object columns**: Data frame object columns are printed in *italics*.

- **Packages**: **R** packages are printed in *italics*.

- **Windows and RStudio panes**: Open windows and RStudio panes are written in
*italics*.

- **Variable names**: Variable names are printed in **bold**. I use CamelBack
for individual variable names.
